# FCC: Product Landing Page

This is my third project of Responsive Web Design Certification of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).
For more info, you can check the [Project Specification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page). 
At the end of the project, this WebSite should be something like the [Target Webpage](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/RKRbwL).
